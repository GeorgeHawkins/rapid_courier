This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This project was written to demonstrate my ability to develop a web app end to end, including developing the front-end, back-end, database and deploying the app.

This app was written with react and node with a sql database handling the user login accounts as well as the jobs and was deployed with Heroku.

The specifications for this project were to be able to login with 1 of 3 available users, after which all courier jobs which were marked as available in the database would be displayed. When a user hits the accept button on the job its status is changed from 'Available' to 'Accepted' and thus that specific job is no longer shown to any logged in users.

You can find this app at: https://cryptic-meadow-44052.herokuapp.com/

The login details are now displayed on the login page.
